# shamanPaint
shaman paint is a paint application that duplicates a users drawn lines in real time

# Use
Draw as if you were using any other paint applicaiton, and watch as your lines are duplicated in a circle centered on the center of the canvas. 
Your color will stay the same as long as you are still holding down the mouse button.
When you draw a new line starting with a new click, you will be drawing with a new color in the same color theme as your previous line.
Color themes are randomized upon the first line drawn in a session.
